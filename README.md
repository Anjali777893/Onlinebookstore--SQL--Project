# Online Book Store â€” SQL Project

Hey there ðŸ‘‹  
Thanks for stopping by! This project is a personal deep dive into how SQL can be used to explore and analyze data from a fictional online bookstore. I wanted to go beyond textbook queries and really understand how data can tell storiesâ€”about customers, inventory, and buying behavior.

### Whatâ€™s inside

I worked with three CSV files:
- **Books.csv** â€” book details like genre, author, price, and stock
- **Customers.csv** â€” customer info including location
- **Orders.csv** â€” purchase history with quantity and total amount

These tables are connected through common columns like `Book_ID` and `Customer_ID`, which made it possible to run some pretty cool queries.

### What I explored

I started with basic stuff like:
- Listing all fiction books
- Finding books published after 1950
- Checking which customers are from Canada
- Tracking orders from November 2023
- Calculating total stock and revenue

Then I got curious and went deeper:
- Which genre sells the most?
- Whatâ€™s the average price of fantasy books?
- Whoâ€™s the most frequent buyer?
- Which author has sold the most books?
- Which cities have customers who spent over $30?

Each query helped me understand how businesses can use SQL to make smarter decisionsâ€”whether itâ€™s restocking inventory, identifying loyal customers, or spotting trends in genre popularity.

### Why I built this

Iâ€™m passionate about making data approachable and useful. This project was a way to practice SQL in a real-world context and sharpen my analytical thinking. It also ties into my interest in marketing analytics and consumer behaviorâ€”how people interact with products, and what that means for strategy.

### Whatâ€™s next

Iâ€™m planning to add visual dashboards (maybe in Power BI) to bring these insights to life. If you have ideas or want to collaborate, Iâ€™d love to hear from you.

Thanks again for checking this out. Hope it sparks some ideas!
